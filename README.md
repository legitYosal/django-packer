## Usefull links 
[django webpack loader package](https://github.com/owais/django-webpack-loader) for django it is very large for my purpose and has problems with webpack>=4.  
[django + webpack](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/webpack-django/), explains about splitChunks and the options for stacking javascript with django.  
[django + webpack](https://pascalw.me/blog/2020/04/19/webpack-django.html), very simple approach.  
[working example repo](https://github.com/pascalw/django-webpack-boilerplate), showing the last working state, why I am doing this? :/
